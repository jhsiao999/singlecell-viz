## Overview


With the ever-increasing throughput and resolution of single-cell technology, we need methods that are able to produce sensible results in a reasonable amount of time. Several factors come into place for the run time of CountClust:

* Number of clusters (K)
* Number of genes
* Number of samples

Here we assess the runtime of CountClust, with an emphasis on runtime under varying K's.

* For 44,020 samples x 100 genes, takes approx. 80 minutes to run K=20. Also this was ran without the step of choosing between multiple starting points. 

* Next step is to look into making this process more efficient, possible through `maptpx` (`OPENMP` parallelization).
